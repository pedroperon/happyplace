# Happy Place

[Android app, native; under development]

This is an app meant to help families in scheduling, organizing and keeping track of day-to-day tasks in the management of their homes. It is made of 2 main modules: a calendar for scheduling household tasks (cleaning, maintenance etc, either one-time or recursive) and a shopping list. These are all shared among all members of the household, to whom individual tasks can be attributed.

## Implementation details

Following most recent native Android development standards and good practices. Uses Jetpack Compose for UI construction, Kotlin language for most of the code, MVVM. Local persistence is achieved asynchronously using protobuf / Java.
